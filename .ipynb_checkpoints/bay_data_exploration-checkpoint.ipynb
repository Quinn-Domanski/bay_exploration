    "\n",
    "Since 1984, sites have been set up around the bay to monitor multiple paramters that could effect the health of The Chesapeake Bay. The health of The Chesapeake Bay refers to the Bay's ability to support diverse aquatic life, through it's intricate natural systems. Some of these parameters include, Temperature ( &deg;C ), Salinity (ppt),  and pH. One important paramter is Total Nitrogen (TN) and Nitrate/Nitrite (NO23), as both of these can cause major problems to the health of the Chesapeake Bay, with an excess of these paramters causing massive algal blooms which consume oxygen creating dead zones (areas with low dissolved oxygen (DO) where marine life can't survive). We want to know:\n",

    "**What causes increased levels of Total Nitrogen and Nitrate/Nitrite?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we analyze parameters that could be correlated to Total Nitrogen and Nitrate/Nitrite, to identify if we can find a trend that causes these to increase. By detecting these patterns we hope to find out what could be causing high levels of both of these in the Bay. This leads us to an overarching question of:\n",
